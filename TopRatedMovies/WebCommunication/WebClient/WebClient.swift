/// WebClient is a class that is responsible to send the web-service data to the server and
/// take care of its connection side challenges like timeout, collecting data, ssl configurations,
/// content-types and content lengths.
///
/// Differences between this class and a web-service is that anything in this class is related
/// to the HTTP web protocol and it do not involve at any business protocol or business challenges
/// like encryption, decryption, checking response as valid string or etc.
